# Smart Hand Bag

A smart wearable hand bag for women safety using physical sensor, shock mechanism, along with recordable camera is proposed. The proposed electronics is placed inside the hand bag with the non-lethal electronic shock protruding outside. A shock mechanism will initially help the women in first level of defense followed by the location of the women via SMS to 3 predefined numbers and police control room. A Recordable camera is in place to record the live video  images and these images are stored on to a SD card. A Buzzer will act as a indicator to others that a particular person is disturbing. A force sensor is attached at the back of the bag. A violent touch of the bag will start the shock generator circuit. The proposed electronics will work based on the emotional status of women. Hence misuse of the wearable device is prevented.

We have interfaced Shock generator module, GSM and GPS, Temperature, force sensor heart beat sensor andL CD display unit to Arduino controller and tested the individual modules as a proof of concept.

b) Development of the proposed womenâ€™s safety wearable handbag-
The primary factor required for women safety is to safeguard them from getting harassed. A  non-lethal attack made by the victim to safe guard from the attackers is highly desired. The second factor considered is the robustness of the system that sends data about the whereabouts of an individual using short message service. The Third factor considered is to make people around aware of the situation that a lady is at risk.
The above factors will be enabled if she press the button or emotional parameters of the body cross a particular threshold level indicating panic, fear and stressed.

safety was in the form of shock generation by switch on the button and touches the shock metal contact to attackers and next is by sending SMS to guardian.
The proposed block diagram for the smart hand bag as shown in figure 2 is for a woman is specially designed for women safety. The Electronics consists of various modules such as GSM, GPS, ATMEL AT mega 328, electric shock generator; LCD, push button and We have also used different sensors like heartbeat sensor, temperature sensor for recognizing emotional change that takes place in the women.
